### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25" height="25"></a>,

I'm Osman Eyser Engin, an ordinary person who interested in Computer Science & Technologies, Computer Engineering (Computer Science) student at Eski≈üehir Technical University. I'm striving to improve my knowledge by developing, staying up-to-date, and learning new things day by day. Most of the projects that I had developed are listed publicly on GitHub because actions speak louder than words.
